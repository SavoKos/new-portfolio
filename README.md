## Description

I am Savo Kos, Front-End Web Developer based in Bosnia.
My story as a Front-End Web Developer begins when I was 16 years old. That is the first time I came across HTML and CSS, and I fell in love. I started learning from then on.

I am a Self-taught Developer and student. Currently, I am unemployed, but I know I will find a job because this is the thing I am really passionate about.

If you have a business proposal, question, or offer, you can contact me by e-mail or using the contact form at the end of the page.
